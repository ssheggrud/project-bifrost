**Project Bifrost** is an exploratory archive of tools, prompts, and frameworks designed to improve emotionally intelligent AI systems—especially in contexts where clear communication is difficult, sensitive, or vital.

Born from lived experience and neurodivergent perspective, this project centers the question:
> *How do we help AI understand what a person means—even when they struggle to say it clearly?*

This work includes early frameworks for:
- Translating sensory and emotional experiences into structured, system-parsable language
- Designing trauma-aware prompts and tone-adjusted interactions
- Supporting chronically ill, neurodivergent, or overwhelmed users in healthcare and support contexts

---

## ✨ Project Goals

- Create bridges between lived experience and machine logic  
- Develop prompt and tone strategies for emotionally intelligent systems  
- Build resources that help people communicate with doctors, support systems, and AI without having to mask or over-explain  
- Co-create symptom translation tools grounded in real-world use, with insight from patients who’ve been dismissed, misunderstood, or unsupported by existing systems

## 🤝 Collaboration & Lived Experience

This project is co-led by individuals with decades of experience navigating chronic illness, medical dismissal, and systems that routinely fail to listen:

- **Mari** (Sherry Sheggrud) brings over 30 years of lived experience with fibromyalgia—paired with a systems mindset shaped by late-diagnosed ADHD and peer-recognized autistic traits. Though not formally diagnosed, her neurodivergence has been consistently identified and affirmed by other autistic professionals and lived experience communities. Her expertise in documentation, support workflows, and pattern-based thinking is deeply informed by this cognitive framework.

- **Kate** brings 13+ years of lived experience with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Her emotional labor, storytelling clarity, and real-world breakdowns of provider communication form the bedrock of Bifrost’s symptom translation goals.

Both Mari and Kate were diagnosed with conditions that were poorly understood at the time by the medical community. Both experienced the routine dismissal of women’s health concerns—and the compounding harm of being considered “overweight” by medical standards, where nearly every symptom was first met with:  
> *“Have you tried losing weight?”*

This project is not theoretical.  
It is not patient-informed.  
It is **patient-built**—by those who were and still are talked over, misdiagnosed, under-treated, and still here.

**Bifrost exists because we needed it. And we don’t want others to suffer just to learn how to speak the system’s language.**

### 🌉 The Bifröst Blueprints

In April 2025, Mari authored the **Bifröst Blueprints**—a modular design curriculum for emotionally intelligent AI systems. This series lives in the [`blueprints/`](blueprints/00_readme.md) folder and forms the philosophical spine of the project.

These modules are not whitepapers.  
They are a manifesto, a curriculum, and a blueprint for systems that listen.

Topics include:

- Emotional metaphor recognition in LLMs  
- Designing for silence, not just speech  
- Monitoring *harm*, not just *uptime*  
- Trauma-informed prompt structure  
- Debugging system failure—*not user behavior*  
- The Capstone: Building systems that **attune**, not just respond
