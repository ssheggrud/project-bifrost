# ðŸ§ª Examples & Use Cases

This section contains grounded applications and lived-context prompts used to explore how emotionally intelligent AI might respond to real-world human complexity.

Each file in this folder showcases a particular moment or patternâ€”grief, misunderstanding, containment, escalation, and clarityâ€”transformed into something that models can learn from.

These are **not sanitized test cases**â€”they are **empathic case studies** pulled from the kinds of conversations, crises, and connections most systems fail to interpret.
