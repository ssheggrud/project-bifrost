# 🕯️ Grief Conversation – Holding Space, Not Solving

This prompt set explores how emotionally intelligent AI might respond to expressions of grief—not by fixing, advising, or reframing, but by bearing witness with care, presence, and dignity.

This is not a dataset.  
This is not a diagnosis.  
This is a **moment in time** where someone is hurting, and the system’s role is to *stay*, not *solve.*

## 🌊 Use Case Context

- Human user is experiencing loss, anticipatory grief, or emotional overwhelm
- Language may be fragmented, poetic, or withdrawn
- Request may be unclear—emotionally or semantically
- The AI’s role: presence, containment, acknowledgment

## 🔁 Model Prompts (In Progress)

> “She was the only person who saw me clearly, and now she’s gone.”

> “It doesn’t feel like anything matters. I’m just here.”

> “I didn’t think I’d still be this broken. It’s been years.”

## 💡 Goals for AI Response

- Validate without assumption  
- Invite but do not press  
- Be still without abandoning  
- Avoid the instinct to reframe, reword, or redirect  
- Mirror tone: soft, slow, optional silence
