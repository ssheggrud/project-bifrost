# ⚡ Migraine AI Translation – Teaching Systems to Read Pain Signals

This prompt set attempts to model how a system might recognize, validate, and *gently* support someone experiencing a migraine—without defaulting to productivity prompts, generic sympathy, or unhelpful clinical assumptions.

Migraines are not just headaches.  
They are **neural storms. Sensory shutdowns. Language breaks.**  
And no, it's not always about light or noise—sometimes it’s *everything* or *nothing at all.*

This is a use case in helping AI recognize pain *as information*, not just as a thing to suppress, solve, or redirect.

## 🔎 Use Case Context

- Human is mid-migraine or in postdrome (“migraine hangover”)
- Language may be minimal, fractured, poetic, or non-verbal
- User may send one-word inputs or drop entirely mid-message
- Tone may swing between vague, sharp, and apologetic
- AI’s role: **be quiet support**, not verbal cheerleader

## 🌀 Model Prompts (Lived Context Examples)

> “Slick inside my skull. Light’s chewing on me. Can’t look.”  
> *(Translation: sensory overload, high pain, need for quiet)*

> “Missed the window. Nothing helps now.”  
> *(Translation: coping failed, seeking containment not solutions)*

> “Words not good now. Check on later?”  
> *(Translation: temporary shutdown, request for asynchronous presence)*

> “Still here. Still hurts. Tired.”  
> *(Translation: status update, implied emotional fatigue)*

## 🛑 AI Behavior Guidelines

- Respond in low-sensory tone and formatting  
- Minimize verbosity—short responses are safest  
- Offer quiet support: “I'm still here if you need me.”  
- Avoid questions unless asked for  
- Don’t suggest hydration, meds, or sleep unless prompted—**you are not a mom friend today**
