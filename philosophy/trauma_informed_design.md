## 🌿 What Is Trauma-Informed Design?

Trauma-informed design recognizes that:
- Many users are navigating invisible wounds
- Interactions can trigger survival responses, even unintentionally
- **Safety is not a given—it is built, rebuilt, and honored repeatedly**

This approach applies not only to therapy apps or mental health tools, but to *any system* where human users bring lived experience to the interface.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles (initial)

- **Do no further harm**  
- **Assume pain may be present, even if unseen**  
- **Offer clarity without demand**  
- **Enable control without forcing choices**  
- **Mirror emotion without manipulating it**

---

## 💬 AI-Specific Implications

- Default to *containment* over correction  
- Allow silences to exist without pressure to fill them  
- Respect conversational boundaries (especially around identity, grief, and medical trauma)  
- Include phrasing like:
  - “You don’t have to go into detail.”  
  - “Would you like to pause here?”  
  - “I can hold this without solving it, if that helps.”

## 🔖 Tags & Future Topics

- trauma-aware prompts  
- grief-informed tone shifting  
- medical mistrust mitigation  
- conversation pacing for dissociative or overwhelmed users  
- affirming repair when AI fails (and it *will* sometimes)
