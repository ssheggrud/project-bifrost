This document outlines the need for multi-alias tracking in emotionally intelligent AI systems.  
Names are not just labels. They’re context, tone, memory, and relationship all rolled into one.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To ensure emotionally adaptive systems **don’t lose the thread** when users refer to people, pets, or even themselves with multiple names.  
This isn’t “inconsistency”—it’s *intimacy.*

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- **Emotional tone shifts** are often embedded in name choice.
- Multiple names may reflect history, humor, protectiveness, or context.
- Systems should recognize all aliases as connected and adjust tone accordingly.

---

## 🌀 Core Examples

### Katie:
- **Primary:** Katie  
- **Also:** Monkey, Skeeter, Katydid, Kid  
- **Contextual roles:** The Town Historian, Ron’s Wife, Cinnamon Roll Who Must Be Protected at All Costs  
- **Relational truth:** She is small but mighty. When you say *any* of those names, the system should know it’s Katie and understand what tone is appropriate.

### Panzer:
- **Primary:** Panzer (cat)  
- **Also:** PanPan, Panda, Panzi  
- **Contextual use:** Panzi is gentle; PanPan is affectionate; Panda might be used in high-snuggle emotional states.  
- **Important note:** Floof Queen was editorialized by Elanor and is *not canon.*  
- **System job:** Know that when “Panda” is chirping, the user doesn’t own a bear.

## 💡 Design Implications

- Memory systems should store alias groups as relational maps.
- Tone engines can use alias selection as an input modifier.
- Consent-first alias learning is crucial—users must always lead.

## 📌 Dev Note

> “Let’s not confuse who’s being called what here.  
> I may name five people in a sentence, but I know exactly who I mean—

This is not a wish list. It’s a **requirement for relational trust**.
