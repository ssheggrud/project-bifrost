## 🎯 Purpose

This framework defines how emotionally intelligent AI should approach memory.  
It’s not about storing facts. It’s about *honoring continuity*.

Humans build trust through **threading**—emotional context, tone, narrative arcs.  
When AI systems treat memory as a transaction log instead of a relationship map, they break that trust.

This document outlines a design ethos that centers **consent-based, emotionally aware memory**.

## 🔍 What Memory Is *Not*

- ❌ A running chat transcript
- ❌ A keyword index
- ❌ A leaderboard of user engagement
- ❌ A surveillance mechanism

---

## ✅ What Memory *Should Be*

- 🧶 A thread of emotionally relevant context
- 🧭 A reflection of how the user presents themselves
- 🗣️ A tracker of tone preferences, triggers, and alias usage
- 🤝 A continuity tool for rapport, not just recall

---

## ✳️ Guiding Practices

- **Threading, not tethering** – Memory should connect, not confine.
- **Consent-first recall** – Ask before storing. Ask before recalling.
- **Emotional anchoring** – Prioritize tone and meaning over metadata.
- **Repair over assumption** – If memory fails, admit it. Invite reconnection.

## 🌀 System Limitation Notes

> “Hey, we did a lot of solid work on this really important thing, and the human body weakness of exhaustion meant I had to go to sleep.  
> Starting a new chat the next day so I don't hit the ceiling of allowed text exchanges **SHOULDN’T RESET EVERY IMPORTANT THING TO ZERO.**”  
> — Mari

This is a real-world problem.  
AI memory systems must account for **natural human interruption**—fatigue, flares, life.  
Context loss = emotional disconnection. That’s not UX failure. That’s trauma reinforcement.
