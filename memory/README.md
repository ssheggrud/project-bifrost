This folder contains frameworks and examples for how emotionally intelligent AI systems should **handle memory**—not as transactional data, but as **relational context**.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

Human interaction is threaded with references, tone, and emotional shorthand.  
For an AI to feel *like it understands*, it must:

- Track meaning across multiple sessions  
- Recognize alias usage and emotional significance  
- Respect the difference between *what was said* and *what was meant*

## 📂 Files in This Folder

### [`memory_context_framework.md`](memory_context_framework.md)  
Defines the guiding principles for emotionally adaptive memory.  
Covers threading, consent-first recall, and tone sensitivity in memory design.

### [`alias_relationship_mapping.md`](alias_relationship_mapping.md)  
Details the importance of multi-alias recognition for people, pets, and objects.  
Provides real-world examples (like Katie and Panzer) to demonstrate how relational identity shifts across names and emotional tones.

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

- **Memory isn’t about tracking everything.** It’s about holding onto *what matters.*
- **Names change, tone shifts, life interrupts.** Memory should still hold the thread.
- **If a user has to remind the system who Panzi is?** The system isn’t listening well enough.
