This folder contains prompt structures, translation aids, and language-mapping tools to help AI systems understand human experience—especially when it's nonlinear, sensory-heavy, or emotionally charged.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal isn’t to oversimplify human feeling into clinical checklists.  
The goal is to build **linguistic bridges** between:

- Emotional distress → system-readable phrasing  
- Sensory experiences → structured inputs  
- Vague overwhelm → clear, consent-based exploration  

These tools are designed for users who may struggle to communicate clearly due to:
- Chronic pain or illness  
- Neurodivergence  
- Emotional dysregulation  
- Fatigue, grief, or trauma states

## 🛠️ Prompt Types to Be Developed

- Sensory overload → descriptive mapping tools  
- "I don’t know what I need" → clarifying scaffolds  
- Medical gaslighting resilience → voice validation prompts  
- Emotion → metaphor → suggestion chains  
- AI fallback phrases when unsure ("Would you like me to offer words, or just hold the silence?")
