This file categorizes symptom descriptions by **sensation type** to support emotionally intelligent systems in **interpreting, expanding, and mirroring** user input that doesn’t follow standard medical language.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Traditional symptom input expects “Where does it hurt? How much? What type?”  
But many users—especially those with neurodivergence, chronic pain, or trauma—don’t **feel** symptoms in textbook terms.

This file builds a reference for:
- AI paraphrasing and clarifying symptom inputs  
- Prompt suggestions that meet the user at their *felt* experience  
- Tone-aware conversational scaffolding for intake, journaling, or dialogue with providers

## 🧠 Early Sensory Buckets

These are **not medical** categorizations.  
They are linguistic tools to help the system mirror sensation-based expression.

---

### 🔥 Heat-based Descriptions

- “Burning behind my eyes”  
- “Like fire ants in my spine”  
- “A slow smolder in my joints”

System might ask:  
> “Is this more of a burning sensation or a hot pressure? Would it help to describe temperature, texture, or motion?”

---

### ⚡ Electrical / Sharp

- “Zaps down my leg”  
- “Buzzing in my hands”  
- “It feels like static and needles”

System might offer:  
> “Is it fast, jolting pain or more of a constant hum? You can describe it however it feels.”

---

### 💨 Pressure / Compression

- “Like a balloon in my chest”  
- “Someone’s pressing down on my skull”  
- “Feels like a vice on my ribs”

---

### 🫧 Tingling / Numbness

- “My fingers are asleep but angry about it”  
- “Like soda bubbles in my foot”  
- “Soft fuzz then nothing”

---

### 🪨 Heaviness / Fatigue

- “My limbs are made of wet sand”  
- “Like gravity turned up to 12”  
- “Can’t lift my own head some days”
