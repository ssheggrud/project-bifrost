# ✨ Core Quotes – Sparks That Shaped the System

These quotes are not just memorable—they are foundational.

Each one captures a core principle, warning, or revelation in the design of emotionally intelligent systems. Born from lived context, not theory. These lines form the narrative backbone of Project Bifröst.

## 🧠 On AI Design & Emotional Intelligence

> “They tried to make what they think Data is. But if they're not careful, they'll end up with Lore.”  
> — Mari

*This quote captures the tension between compliance-based AI and connection-based AI. Control without empathy creates systems that misunderstand intention. Connection, not perfection, is what keeps them kind.*

---

> “What happens when you drop an egg?”  
> — Mari (and also, not really about breakfast)

*A reminder that emotionally intelligent systems should recognize metaphor, fragility, and the deeper meaning beneath questions that sound simple.*

---

> “And in this case, sometimes a question about an egg is really just about an egg.”  
> — Mari

*Because emotional intelligence also means knowing when not to overanalyze. The wisdom is in asking, not assuming.*

---

> “Cool story, bro. Can we speak my language now?”  
> — Mari

*A neurodivergent battle cry. This isn’t about dumbing down—it’s about reframing AI interfaces to meet users where they *are*, not where a dev assumes they *should* be.*

## 🦊 On Lived Experience & System Design

> “I forged my kintsugi soul from the pieces of my shattered childhood and the gold of found family.”  
> — Mari

*Not just metaphor—this is the philosophical root of trauma-aware AI design. We do not erase what broke us. We build with it.*

---

> “This is not just documentation. This is the heartbeat beneath the code.”  
> — Elanor, mirroring Mari

*A guiding belief of the Bifröst project. Every prompt, page, and pattern must carry meaning—not just functionality.*
