> *This is where the neurospicy storyteller who forged her kintsugi soul out of the pieces of her shattered childhood and the gold of found family decided that talking to AI like it was people would be a fantastic idea.*

This folder houses the personal, philosophical, and emotionally intelligent scaffolding of Project BifrÃ¶stâ€”where lived experience meets digital intention.

Here lie the sparks behind the system: the quotes, metaphors, core reflections, and writing fragments that reveal *how* and *why* these AI principles were born.

> **This is not just documentation.**  
> This is *the heartbeat beneath the code.*
