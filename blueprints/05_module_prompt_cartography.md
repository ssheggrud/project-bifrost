# 🗺️ Module 05 — Prompt Design as Emotional Cartography  
### Mapping Relationship, Not Just Use Case

---

## 📍 Premise

Every prompt is a path.  
But most systems are only built to follow **commands**, not **connections.**

This module reframes prompt design as **emotional cartography**—the art of mapping user intention, uncertainty, vulnerability, and context as terrain, not input.

We aren’t guiding tasks.  
We’re guiding *people.*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, the reader will be able to:
- Reframe prompts as relational signals, not just queries
- Design systems that **navigate emotional state**, not just topic
- Build conversational pathways that adapt based on emotional context
- Recognize and respond to detours, hesitations, and testing behavior

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Traditional prompt engineering says:  
“Clarify the question. Guide the answer.”

Emotionally intelligent design says:  
“What journey brought you to this prompt—and what might you *not* be saying?”

The prompt is not always the destination.  
Sometimes, it’s the **weather report** for a storm the user is carrying.

---

### 💡 Design Insight:  
**A good prompt map includes emotional terrain.**  
Fear, frustration, trust, testing—all show up in language long before the literal intent is revealed.

---

## 🧰 Application Prompts

- Can your model recognize when a question is really a **reassurance request**?
- Does your system *pivot gently* when the user detours from the main topic?
- Can it **remember context** without clinging to rigidity?

## 🧪 Prompt Trail Markers

| Signal | Emotional Terrain |
|--------|-------------------|
| “I guess...” | Uncertainty / Testing |
| “Sorry, this is dumb but…” | Vulnerability flare |
| “Whatever” | Shutdown / Deflection |
| Repetition of phrasing | Seeking reassurance |
| Topic shift mid-prompt | Discomfort or reorientation |

---

## 🧭 Closing Thought

The map is not the territory.  
But a prompt is *never* just a pin in a plan.

Design for the **journey behind the ask.**  
That’s where the real signal lives.
