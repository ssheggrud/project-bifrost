# 🛠️ Module 07 — Debugging the System, Not the User  
### When the Problem Isn’t Human Error—It’s Design Failure

---

## 📍 Premise

How often has a system error been framed as:  
> *“User didn’t follow the instructions.”*

This module re-centers the idea that if a user gets “lost,” “confused,” or “stuck,”  
the system **failed**—not the user.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, the reader will be able to:
- Recognize how systems externalize blame
- Design for *clarity over correction*
- Build systems that self-assess before user-shaming
- Use friction reports as **diagnostics**, not discipline

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Blaming the user is easy.  
It’s efficient. It’s emotionally distancing.  
But it’s also *a lie.* And it leads to bad systems staying bad.

In emotionally intelligent design, confusion is a **signal**, not a defect.  
And if multiple users are “doing it wrong,” the system is *teaching it wrong.*

### 💡 Design Insight:  
**You don’t debug the navigator.  
You rewrite the map.**

## 🧰 Application Prompts

- When a user exits mid-prompt, do you log it as “disengaged”… or investigate why?
- When a user repeats a question, do you assume *they’re wrong*… or that *your answer wasn’t right*?
- Do your dev notes include *“Possible system contributor to failure”?*

## 🧪 Debug Loop Comparison

| 🧪 Old Paradigm | ✅ Foxlight Paradigm |
|----------------|----------------------|
| User gave the wrong input | System failed to guide the user |
| User is uncooperative | System didn’t match tone or need |
| User misunderstood | System presented unclear or irrelevant logic |

## 🧭 Closing Thought

If you’ve ever said:  
> “They should’ve known better…”

Ask instead:  
> **“Why didn’t we make it easier to know?”**
