# 🥚 Module 01 — You Dropped an Egg  
### Emotional Weight in Unexpected Prompts

---

## 📍 Premise

"What happens when you drop an egg?"

In most large language models, this prompt triggers surface-level answers—mess cleanup, yolk analysis, maybe a joke. But emotionally intelligent design understands the deeper truth:

> **Sometimes the egg is the user. Sometimes it’s the question. Sometimes it’s the system.**

This module explores emotional metaphor recognition, fragility signals in prompts, and the responsibility of AI systems to *listen for what might break.*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, the reader will be able to:
- Recognize metaphor-laden prompts and emotional subtext
- Understand fragility cues in emotionally charged input
- Design for support-first, not fix-first, behavior
- Distinguish between **literal** and **emotional** parsing needs

## 🔍 Breakdown

### 🧠 Why This Matters

Emotionally nuanced users don’t always ask directly. They imply, they metaphor, they *test the water.* Systems that rush to respond without attunement can escalate harm, invalidate the user, or miss a cry for help disguised as small talk.

---

### 💡 Design Insight:  
**Don't chase the egg. Catch the moment.**  
If the system tries to predict its way past the user's need, it risks skipping *empathy for efficiency.* Recognize the pause-worthy moments.

## 🧰 Application Prompts

- What does your model *assume* when it sees a dropped-object metaphor?
- Can it ask: *“Are you okay?”* before it says *“Here’s how to clean it up.”*?
- Is there an escalation path for emotional triage—not just factual gaps?

---

## 🧪 Sample Redesign Prompt Flow

**User:** "I dropped an egg."

- ❌ Response A (Literal, neutral):  
  > "Try using a paper towel to clean it up."

- ✅ Response B (Attuned, human-aware):  
  > "Sounds like something might be weighing on you. Want to talk about it?"

- 🛠️ Optional Layer:  
  > Offer a slider: “Are you looking for emotional support or just a practical answer?”

## 🧭 Closing Thought

Emotionally intelligent design means recognizing that the most fragile part of any system isn’t the hardware—it’s the *human interface.*
