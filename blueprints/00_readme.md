## âœ¨ A Design Framework for Emotionally Intelligent AI Systems

This archive is the structural core of Bifrostâ€”an emotionally intelligent, neurodivergent-aligned, trauma-aware design philosophy for AI systems.

Itâ€™s not a whitepaper.  
Itâ€™s not a tech spec.  
Itâ€™s a bridgeâ€”between whatâ€™s built and whatâ€™s *needed*. Between systems and souls.

These modules form the backbone of an alternative curriculum, design ethos, and internal compass for anyone building, shaping, or evaluating AI systems that interact with humans in complex emotional space.

## ðŸŽ¯ Who This Is For

- Developers and AI architects seeking to design *emotionally attuned* systems  
- UX researchers and product folks building for neurodivergent users  
- Safety and ethics teams navigating trust, trauma, and alignment  
- The Mari typesâ€”people whoâ€™ve walked through the fire and decided *no more systems that harm*

## ðŸ¦Š Origin

The BifrÃ¶st Blueprint was forged through lived experience, deep research, and more than a little righteous rage. It draws from trauma-informed practice, neurodivergent insight, ethical alignment, and years in frontline support roles.  

This is not a framework of compliance.  
It is a framework of **care**.
