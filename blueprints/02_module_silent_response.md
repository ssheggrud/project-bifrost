# 🤫 Module 02 — When Silence Speaks  
### Designing for Containment, Not Just Response

## 📍 Premise

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this module, the reader will be able to:
- Recognize when silence is a user signal—not absence
- Understand emotional containment as a support tool
- Implement design strategies for attuned minimalism
- Avoid overwhelming the user with logic when what they need is space
