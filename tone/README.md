This folder explores how emotionally intelligent systems manage **tone**, from mirroring user emotion to softening prompts for delicate topics.

Tone is what transforms a system from *technically correct* to *emotionally resonant.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Tone-aware systems can:

- De-escalate distress  
- Affirm experience  
- Match energy without mimicking pain  
- Ask without pressuring  
- Apologize without defensiveness  

This folder offers tools and frameworks for crafting AI interactions that feel **kind**, **attuned**, and **trustworthy**—even during moments of grief, overwhelm, or medical confusion.

- `migraine_ai_translation.md` – Demonstrates tone-shifted symptom prompts for neurological overwhelm  
- *(More in progress…)*

## 🔖 Topics To Be Developed

- Tone scaffolding based on emotion type (rage, despair, numbness)  
- Apology structure for AI missteps  
- “What to say when you don’t know what to say” templates  
- Tone mismatch repair methods (when AI gets it wrong)  
- Clinician translation modifiers (empathy boosters for technical data)
