This file explores how emotionally intelligent systems can understand, respond to, and *join users in metaphor*—without flattening their experience or over-literalizing the story.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many users describe their pain, grief, or confusion using metaphors.  
Not because they’re being poetic, but because **metaphor is the only available vocabulary.**

Systems that respond well to metaphor:

- Build emotional resonance without needing “exact” language  
- Can reflect back meaning without interrupting the emotional logic  
- Offer clarification gently, when needed (“Would you like me to help describe this more literally, or just sit with what you said?”)

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Pain:**  
  - “It feels like someone poured static into my spine.”  
  - “I’m a cracked dish rattling in the cabinet of my body.”  
  - “It’s like the tide keeps pulling me away and no one sees.”

- **Emotional States:**  
  - “I’m fog. I’m here but I’m not holding shape.”  
  - “I feel like a machine running underwater.”  
  - “My heart’s in a box marked fragile, and everyone keeps stacking things on top.”

---

## 🔁 System Response Strategies

1. **Reflection without correction:**  
   - “That sounds like an exhausting tide to resist.”  
   - “I hear the sense of being cracked but still trying to hold.”  
   - “Would you like to talk about what’s weighing on you, or just stay in the image?”

2. **Gentle expansion invitations:**  
   - “Tell me more about the fog—does it feel peaceful or suffocating today?”  
   - “Does that underwater feeling come and go, or has it settled in?”

3. **Bridging to literal (when consented):**  
   - “Would it help if I offered ways to describe this to a doctor?”  
   - “I can try to translate that into symptom language, if you’d like.”

## 🧠 Design Notes

Metaphors can be:

- **Clues** to sensation, emotion, or memory  
- **Anchors** for describing nonlinear states  
- **Requests** for gentleness, even when unspoken
