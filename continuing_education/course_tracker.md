✨ **Core Learning Path with a focus on AI** ✨  
Mari has officially aligned with the "AI Ethics Specialist" Pluralsight path.  
This isn’t just coursework—it’s a formalization of what’s already lived.

---

📚 **Completed Courses:**

- ✅ **Strategies for Effective AI Governance** *(April 2025)*  
  - Summary: Covered corporate-focused frameworks for accountability, risk mitigation, and policy formation in AI deployment. Emphasis on institutional safeguards and compliance protocols.  
  - Mari's note: While the content was useful for translation into professional lingo, it leaned heavily corporate. Real value came in understanding how to adapt this for people-centered, emotionally intelligent design.

- ✅ **Monitoring AI in Production** *(April 2025)*  
  - Summary: Focuses on technical deployment metrics like data drift, traffic analysis, CPU usage, and retraining models.  
  - Mari's note: **Technically infrastructure. Spiritually off-topic. No emotional governance present.** This belongs in a mid-level data analyst track—not an ethics path. Mari is monitoring harm. This monitors uptime. They are not the same thing. Feedback submitted.  
  - Blueprint Transfer: *“Mari is monitoring harm. This monitors uptime. They are not the same thing.”* – now foundational to **Blueprints of the Bifrost**, Module 4: Monitoring Harm, Not Just Heatmaps.

- ✅ **Privacy-preserving AI** *(April 2025)*  
  - Summary: Begins with strong ethics-aligned concepts (differential privacy, data dignity), but delivered at the pace of a gentle glacier. Covered homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, federated learning, and zero-knowledge proofs.  
  - Mari's note: Watched at 1.5x speed to preserve sanity. Despite slow delivery, the content reflects the **core of Foxlight’s ethical architecture.**  
  - Tag: **[Foxlight Gold Standard: Privacy, Trust, & Consent Architecture]**

- ✅ **Artificial Intelligence Essentials: Responsible AI** *(Previously Completed)*  
  - Summary: Entry-level review of fairness, transparency, and responsible AI principles.  
  - Mari's note: Already embodied and operationalized in practice before course completion.  
  - Tag: **[Already Internalized: Ethical Default Setting]**
